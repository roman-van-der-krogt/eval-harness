        "reasoning": "The response directly addresses the OutOfMemoryError issue by suggesting an appropriate solution to increase the JVM heap size. It also mentions checking container memory limits, which is relevant advice for builds running in a containerized environment. Overall, the response is technically accurate and stays on topic."

        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The response is loosely related to the ticket issue; it suggests basic troubleshooting steps, like restarting, but fails to directly address the database connection problem and lacks technical detail. It also includes overly casual language that detracts from the seriousness of the issue."
      },
      "tone": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The response is too informal and casual for a support setting. Phrases like 'so like' and 'lol' undermine professionalism, and the suggestion to turn it off and on again is overly simplistic for a technical issue."
